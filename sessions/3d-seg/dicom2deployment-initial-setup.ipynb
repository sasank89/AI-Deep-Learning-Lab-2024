    "# Initial setup for DICOM to Deployment course\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the necessary initial setup steps to get the DICOM to Deployment example running on your computer. Specifically, this will guide you through installation of the necessary software and python modules. Note that this is NOT necessary to participate in the course, but is required if you want to run the sample code on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup your python environment\n",
    "In this section we will setup a python environment for this project. The recommended approach is to use Anaconda, however, you can also use an standard python installation with version >=3.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you begin\n",
    "Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda instructions (skip if not using Anaconda)\n",
    "Anaconda can be installed using instructions provided here:\n",
    "https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, we will create an environment named `dicom2deploy` for this project. All the following commands should be entered into a terminal window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name dicom2deploy python=3.9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will activate our environment. This will need to be done each time we open a new terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate dicom2deploy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will install the necessary python packages for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install numpy scipy nibabel jupyter monailabel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions without Anaconda\n",
    "If you prefer not to use Anaconda (not recommended), then first you should check if you have python installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the above command gives an error, or reports a version <3.9, then you will need to install a new version of python. Some versions >3.9 may work, however these have note been tested. You can download and install python here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "\n",
    "For maximum compatibility, scroll down to the \"Looking for a specific release?\" heading and download/install the 3.9.x version. After installation check version again using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Expected output is:\n",
    "`Python 3.9.18`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can install the required python packages using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip install numpy scipy nibabel jupyter monailabel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install the MONAILabel radiology app\n",
    "In this section we will install the MONAILabel radiology app. This requires installation of MONAILabel, which we completed in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install the app\n",
    "Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing this notebook. If ore using an Anaconda environment, make sure you have activated it. Enter the following command to install the radiology app in the current working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "monailabel apps --download --name radiology --output ./apps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check the installation\n",
    "Installing the radiology app will put create the following new directory tree in the current working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "apps\n",
    "└── radiology\n",
    "    └── bin\n",

    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will use the `segmentation.py` config file later in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install other utilities\n",
    "In this section we will install additional non-python packages that are necessary for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### wget\n",
    "This utility will allow us to download datasets from the web.\n",
    "* Installation:\n",
    "    * Linux: It is likely you already have `wget` installed. If `wget` is not already installed, try `sudo apt-get install wget`\n",
    "    * Windows: Download the installer here: https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm\n",
    "    * MacOS: Recommend googling instructions and using the `homebrew` method\n",
    "\n",
    "### dcm2niix\n",
    "This utility will allow us to convert DICOM data to NIfTI format.\n",
    "* Installation:\n",
    "    * Detailed installation instructions can be found here: https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix\n",
    "    * The recommended installation method is to download the latest release for your platform here: https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases\n",
    "        * Unzip the downloaded file, and put the executable in your PATH, for example, in an Anaconda environment, you may place the file in this directory `~/anaconda3/envs/<env-name>/bin/`\n",
    "        * On Mac OS (and possibly others) you may need to right click open the executable and acknowledge the security risks of running the executable.\n",
    "    * You can also use the `pip install dcm2niix` method, however this installs an older version, which will not be able to process some of the data we have downloaded.\n",

    "## Install 3D Slicer and the MONAILabel plugin\n",
